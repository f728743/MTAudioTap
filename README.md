# MTAudioTap

MTAudioTap is an iOS application that visualizes audio spectra in real-time using Swift and SwiftUI. It processes audio from a provided URL and displays the frequency spectrum as a dynamic visual representation. The application leverages the `MTAudioProcessingTap` API from AVFoundation to tap into the audio stream and perform real-time audio analysis.

## Features
- **Real-Time Audio Spectrum Visualization**: Displays a frequency spectrum with customizable frequency bands using SwiftUI.
- **Audio Playback**: Supports playback of audio files from a URL with play, pause, and stop functionality.
- **Spectrum Analysis**: Uses the Accelerate framework to perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis.
- **Customizable UI**: Visualizes multiple audio channels with distinct colors for each spectrum.

## Technical Details
- **Audio Processing**: The app uses `MTAudioProcessingTap` to intercept and process audio buffers during playback. This allows real-time access to raw audio data for spectrum analysis.
- **Spectrum Analysis**: The `SpectrumAnalyzer` class uses the Accelerate framework to compute the FFT of audio data, generating frequency spectra for visualization.
- **SwiftUI Interface**: The `AudioSpectra` and `AudioSpectrum` views render the spectrum data as a dynamic bar graph, with each bar corresponding to a frequency band.
- **Architecture**: The app follows a modular design with components like `AudioPlayer`, `AudioTapProcessor`, and `SpectrumAnalyzer` handling specific responsibilities.

## Notes
- The app uses sample audio URLs for demonstration. Replace these URLs in `MediaPlayerViewModel.swift` with your own audio files if needed.
- Ensure a stable internet connection for streaming audio from URLs.
- The spectrum visualization is optimized for a sample rate of 48kHz and an FFT size of 2048.
